### Notes from the introduction (p.2 - 6)

- reversal of the Flynn Effect, declining IQ
- evidence suggests that this is related to the use external digital aids, instead of memorization and practice, combined with digital distractions
- question: does increased reliance on external memory aids and digital distractions quietly erode our cognitive abilities we aim to enhance?
- popular educational practice treats knowledge as separate from skills
- neuroscience says: knowledge and skill are deeply intertwined (two sides of same coin)
- essential: have key information embedded in our memory
- popular educational approach: "be a guide on the side, instead of a sage on the stage"
- BUT: sometimes the **sage on the stage** is invaluable
- biologically primary knowledge - acquired without explicit teaching
	- language
	- facial recognition
- biological secondary knowledge - requires deliberate instruction
	- reading
	- mathematics
	- science
	- (formally taught academic skills and content)
- brains are not wired to effortlessly internalize secondary knowledge
	- needs deliberate practice and repeated retrieval
- excessive cognitive offloading interrupts the necessary internalization
	- leading to superficial and weak **schemata** (term for mental framework organizing knowledge into meaningful patterns)
	- these weak mental frameworks can't adequately support critical thinking or creative problem-solving
- effective learning
	- brain's dual memory systems
		- Declarative Memory: consciously recallable explicit facts and concepts
		- Procedural Memory: skills and routines that become second nature
	- building genuine expertise
		- reshaping neural networks through countless hours of internalizing information
		- moving knowledge from declarative to the procedural memory system
		- practice a fact or skill until it embeds deeply in the subconscious circuits
		- supporting intuition and fluent thinking
		- instantly recognizing patterns
		- effortlessly deploying rich knowledge
- Schemata 
	- internalized neural networks forming mental structures
	- organize knowledge
	- facilitate complex thinking
	- intuitive numerical understanding (mathematics)
	- enhanced comprehension of narratives and themes (literature)
	- schemata develop through
		- active engagement and practice
		- each recall strengthening mental frameworks
	- metaphors can enrich schemata by linking unfamiliar concepts to familiar experiences
- Looking things up instead of internalizing impedes expertise, resulting in
	- shallow schemata
	- limited understanding
	- reduced cross-domain thinking
- science of memory
- debunk the false choice between knowledge and skills
- strong memory foundation empowers skillful thinking
- neuroscientific evidence: memory retrieval and practice strengthen learning
- engage people in a conversation about the importance of knowing in the age of information
- call for balance
	- augmentation without atrophy
	- embrace smart technologies and abundant information
	- keep exercising our biological memory and attention
- In a world where we can look up almost everything, the knowledge we carry inside our heads is more valuable than ever.
