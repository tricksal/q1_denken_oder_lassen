Question pops up in my head: "What do I really want to be an expert in?". I have to be very smart and intentional about that, then systematically direct my efforts to build and train this expertise. Maybe also check my existing expertise, and think about potential blind spots or gaps. Also, be very honest and intentional about how to improve here.
Remember: Knowledge can be acquired, even deep understanding, but it requires serious effort, so think about it.
